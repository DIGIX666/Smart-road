## Overview

The "Smart Road" project aims to develop a cutting-edge traffic control strategy and simulation for managing intersections without relying on traditional traffic lights. The primary goal is to address traffic congestion issues, reduce travel time for drivers, minimize environmental impact, and pave the way for the integration of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into the traffic system.


## Objectives

The primary objectives of the "Smart Road" project are as follows:

1. **Intersection Management:** Develop a smart intersection management strategy that eliminates the need for traditional traffic lights and optimizes traffic flow for both autonomous and human-driven vehicles.

2. **Traffic Congestion Reduction:** Minimize traffic congestion by implementing an intelligent algorithm that efficiently controls the movement of vehicles through intersections.

3. **Collision Avoidance:** Ensure collision-free passage for autonomous vehicles by designing an algorithm that considers the unique characteristics and capabilities of AVs.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the "Smart Road" project:

1. ```bash
   git clone
    ```
2. ```bash
   cd smart-road
    ```
3. ```bash
    cargo build
    ```
4. ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
5. Play with A S D W keys or arrow keys to move the car
